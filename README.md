# HUST-ParallelProgramming-HeatEquation

## Project Description

Parallel programming is a key approach for speeding up numerical algorithms. This pa-
per focuses on parallelizing a program designed to solve the two-dimensional shallow water
equation, which serves as an example of a conservation law. The equation is tackled using finite
difference and finite volume techniques, applying schemes such as the Lax-Friedrichs and
Lax-Wendroff methods (we exploit 3 algorithms). The parallel implementation employs both
MPI and CUDA. Performance evaluation is primarily conducted on shared memory systems,
and due to the availability of a sufficient number of processors, results are also presented for
MPI and CUDA
